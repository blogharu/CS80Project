# Capstone Project

Our Capstone Project is a project to automate SolidWorks operations from: generating new randomized objects to creating variables and constraints to keep objects in a certain shape and size, and optimize the objects based off of experimental data using statistics.

## Installation

Clone the repository into a given directory

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/blogharu/CS80Project.git
```

## Dependencies

This projects uses:

- Visual Studio
- C#
- SolidWorks 2019
- Python3
- Iron Python

This project also uses references in Visual Studios to run properly:

Iron Python: 

- IronPython
- IronPython.Modules
- IronPython.SQLite
- IronPython.Wpf

SolidWorks:

- SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks
- SolidWorks.Interop.swcommands
- SolidWorks.Interop.swconst
- SolidWorks.Interop.swdocumentmg
- SolidWorks.Interop.swpublished

## Usage

With all of the dependencies, this program runs via the run button in Visual Studios. SolidWorks should launch, and there will be a Pikachu button that is this add-on. There are a series of features such as:

- Adding and Deleting variables
- Listing variables
- Adding and Deleting constraints
- Listing constraints
- Auto generating a certain number of random objects and saving them as either STL or SLDWRKS files
- Running a dataset through the Python optimization program.

This program uses a formatted file for the datasets thats auto generated by the add-on. The Python optimization program uses this same file but with filled in data for the experimental data that is left blank upon generation.
