# Capstone Project

Our Capstone Project is a project to automate SolidWorks operations from: generating new randomized objects to creating variables and constraints to keep objects in a certain shape and size, and optimize the objects based off of experimental data using statistics.

## Installation

Clone the repository into a given directory

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/blogharu/CS80Project.git
```

## Dependencies

This projects uses:

- Visual Studio
- C#
- SolidWorks 2019
- Python3
  - NumPy
  - SciPy

This project also uses references in Visual Studios to run properly:

SolidWorks:

- SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks
- SolidWorks.Interop.swcommands
- SolidWorks.Interop.swconst
- SolidWorks.Interop.swdocumentmg
- SolidWorks.Interop.swpublished

## Usage

Once cloned into a directory and having referenced all of the dependencies, one can build this project in Visual Studios using admin/root privillages, then start SolidWorks, and there will be a Pikachu icon on the left menu bar; this is the add-on. There are a variety of features such as:

- Adding and Deleting variables
- Listing variables
- Adding and Deleting constraints
- Listing constraints
- Auto generating a certain number of random objects and saving them as either STL or SLDWRKS files
- Running a dataset through the Python optimization program.

This program uses a formatted file for the datasets thats auto generated by the add-on. The Python optimization program uses this same file but with filled in data for the experimental data that is left blank upon generation.

In short, the steps to use the program are as follows:
1. Download the code from github,
2. Open the program in Visual Studios in Administrator Mode (It's crucial that it's done in administrator mode, to allow the necessary permissions)
3. Open the solution from our github.
4. Grab the following files from your SolidWorks folder found on the C Drive:
- SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.dll

- SolidWorks.Interop.sw3dprinter.dll

- SolidWorks.Interop.swcommands.dll

- SolidWorks.Interop.swconst.dll

- SolidWorks.Interop.swdimxpert.dll

- SolidWorks.Interop.swdocumentmgr.dll

- SolidWorks.Interop.swmotionstudy.dll

- SolidWorks.Interop.swpublished.dll

- SolidWorks.Interop.SWRotuingLib.dll

4.5 Place them in CS80project->bin-Debug

5. Build the program but don't run it.

6. Launch SolidWorks, click the pikachu icon and connect the python.exe
