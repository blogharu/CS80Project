Feedback:
"I would consider shipping
this code with the necessary
Solidworks files already included"

Response: Unfortunately, there is no simple way to do this, as the necessary files are exclusive to the user's 
computer and thus varies between users

Feedback: 
"Code documentation was fairly sparse.
Many of the comments were either really short or redundant. For example one function called
“UnregisterAssembly” simply had the comment “Unregister” which was rather self-explanatory. I
would have liked to see better commenting regarding what everything does since most of the
comments were only a few words long and a sentence at most."

Response: We've added several more comments now to our files that are hopefully more clear, and make it easier
for the user to follow along with the code

Feedback:
"You talked about changing the success
messages to showing a symbol other
than the yellow exlamation mark and I
think that would be a good usability
change to resolve"

Response: 
Though we didn't have it fully working at the time of review, all success/ non-error messages now show a less severe icon
instead of the yellow exclamation triangle.
